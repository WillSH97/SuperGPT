0,Super guarantee penalties,"If you do not meet your super guarantee (SG) obligations, you may have to pay additional penalties or charges on top of the super guarantee charge (SGC).
You're liable for a Part 7 penalty – Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SGAA) if you:
lodge your SGC statement late, or
fail to provide a statement or information when requested during an audit.
The maximum penalty is 200% of the SGC.
If you pay less of the SGC than you should because you made a false or misleading statement, you may receive an administrative penalty.
The base penalty amount can:
be up to 75% of the shortfall
vary according to your situation.
If you make arrangements to avoid super guarantee obligations, you may incur the charge you avoided plus an additional penalty.
If you are a director of a company, you need to pay the SGC in full by the due date. If you do not, you'll be liable for a penalty equal to the unpaid amount.
When an SGC amount remains outstanding, we may issue a director penalty notice. Even without issuing a notice, we can collect the penalty by other means. For example, by withholding a tax refund.
The penalty is reduced if your company pays the outstanding amount at any time. Under some conditions, it may be reduced if your company goes into voluntary administration or liquidation.
This additional charge applies if you:
lodge an SGC statement, or
we have raised SGC assessments but you do not pay the super guarantee charge by the due date.
GIC:
will continue to increase from the date your SGC is due up to the date you pay your SGC amount in full
is calculated on a daily compounding basis
is tax-deductible in the year you incur it.
If you do not comply with your choice of fund obligations you could receive a 'choice shortfall' penalty.
A choice shortfall penalty applies if you:
do not give your eligible employee a Superannuation standard choice form within the required timeframe
pay your eligible employee's super to a complying fund but not the fund they chose or not their stapled super fund (if one exists) for a new employee from 1 November that did not choose a fund – you can request stapled super fund details for employees from us
charge your employee a fee for implementing their choice of fund.
The choice shortfall penalty increases the SGC.
The maximum fine for an individual convicted of failing to keep records is 30 penalty units. You may also be liable for an administrative penalty of 20 penalty units.
If an eligible employee has provided a TFN to you and you do not provide the employee's TFN to their super fund or retirement savings account within the required time, you're liable 10 penalty units.
The TFN is required at the time you make the super guarantee contribution. If the employee provides the TFN to you less than 14 days before the next contribution, you must pass on the TFN within 14 days.
If you don't meet your super guarantee (SG) obligations, you may have to pay additional penalties or charges on top of the super guarantee charge.",https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/missed-and-late-super-guarantee-payments/super-guarantee-penalties/
1,Bilateral social security agreements,"Bilateral social security agreements are international agreements Australia has entered into with some countries to prevent double payment of super.
Employees are only eligible to apply for a certificate of coverage if they accept an Australian employer's offer to work temporarily overseas. The nominated country must have a bilateral social security agreement with Australia.
You are not eligible if:
you're an employee and you take a new job opportunity overseas
you're self-employed.
Bilateral social security agreements deal with the issue of 'double super coverage'. This occurs when an employer sends an employee to work temporarily overseas and is required to pay super (or equivalent) in both countries.
These agreements allow employers to apply for a certificate of coverage. The certificate exempts the employer from paying super (or equivalent) in the other country.
With a certificate of coverage, the employee is covered by a bilateral social security agreement. The super guarantee (SG) contributions are only required under the law of the country that your employee is most likely to retire in.
For each country there is a specific:
start date for the bilateral agreement
maximum period for a certificate of coverage.
These are set out in Countries with an agreement.
Example: sending an Australian employee to work temporarily overseas
Misha's Australian employer sends her to work in Austria for 2 years. While working in Austria, Misha is covered by Australia's super guarantee (SG) legislation and the Austrian laws. Therefore, double super coverage occurs.
Misha's employer can apply for a certificate of coverage. This will exempt Misha and her employer from making super contributions under the Austrian law.
Micha's employer must continue to make SG contributions in Australia.
End of example
Bilateral agreements only apply to employee SG contributions made on or after the start date of the relevant agreement.
Generally, for:
self-employed people – are not subject to SG in Australia and there is no double liability for superannuation
diplomats and consular officials – the agreements apply, however the provisions of the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic or Consular relations are not affected
workers on a ship or aircraft in international traffic – the laws of the worker's resident country apply (except Japan)
government workers – there is no maximum period for a certificate of coverage.
There are exceptions to these rules, which are explained in Countries with an agreement.
The following countries have a bilateral social security agreement with Australia. These agreements all work in the way explained above. In addition, a few have special rules, which are noted below.

The German agreement operates differently to most of the agreements Australia has with other countries.
When you apply for a certificate of coverage, you must indicate the relevant article of the agreement that applies to the employment situation.
Article 5 applies where the:
employee remains employed by the same employer
period of working in Germany is up to 4 years
employee is a resident of Australia.
Example: detachment cases (Article 5)
Franz-Peter's Australian employer, XYZ Bank Limited sends him to work in Germany for 2 years.
While in Germany, Franz-Peter remains directly employed by XYZ Bank Limited. Franz-Peter is covered by Australia's SG legislation and the German laws.
As double super coverage occurs, Article 5 of the supplementary agreement will take effect. It will exempt Franz-Peter and his employer from making contributions under the German law.
XYZ Bank Limited will continue to make contributions as required under SG legislation in Australia.
When applying for a certificate of coverage, XYZ Bank Limited must indicate that Article 5 is applicable to Franz-Peter's circumstances.
End of example
Article 8 applies where the:
employee is employed temporarily by an associated employer
period of secondment is up to 5 years
application for a certificate of coverage is made within 6 months of starting employment in Germany.
Example: secondment cases (Article 8)
Kristina's Australian employer, JKL Pharmaceuticals Limited sends her to work in Germany for 2 years.
While in Germany, Kristina is employed by JKL Medical Research AG, a subsidiary of JKL Pharmaceuticals Limited. Kristina is covered by Australia's SG legislation and the German laws.
As double super coverage occurs and Kristina is employed by an associated employer, Article 8 of the supplementary agreement will take effect. It exempts Kristina and her employer from making contributions under German law.
JKL Pharmaceuticals Limited will continue to make contributions as required under super guarantee legislation in Australia.
When applying for a certificate of coverage, JKL Pharmaceuticals Limited must indicate that Article 8 of the supplementary agreement is applicable to Kristina's circumstances.
End of example
The agreement applies to:
Australian employees – those who are seconded (up to 4 years) by their Australian employer to work in Greece for a related entity
Greek self-employed – those who are deemed to be self-employed by the Greek authorities but employed in Australia by an Australian employer. They may be eligible for a certificate of coverage provided their Australian employer continues to pay super contributions for them in Australia.
The employment in Australia can be completely unrelated to a person's 'self-employed' status in Greece.
Before your employee starts work in Norway, you must send a copy of the certificate of coverage to:

2,Withholding payer number super obligations,"We give certain partners in partnerships and non-individual entities a withholding payer number (WPN). This is so you can meet your tax and superannuation obligations.
A WPN is only offered to entities who are not eligible for an ABN, have PAYG withholding obligations and are required to pay super for eligible employees.
WPN holders must make super guarantee (SG) contributions for their eligible employees to avoid the super guarantee charge (SGC).
Non-individual WPN holders include:
embassies
international entities
school canteens
sporting clubs.
If you are eligible for a WPN but don't have one, you can complete the form on the Application to register a PAYG withholding account page.

4,Clearing house privacy,"The information you provide to the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (the clearing house) will be used for the purpose of administering the clearing house.
The ATO is a government agency bound by the Privacy Act 1988 in terms of collection and handling of personal information and tax file numbers (TFNs). For further information about privacy law notices please go to ato.gov.au/privacy.
The collection of this information is authorised by the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
This information may be disclosed to the relevant super funds and financial institutions in relation to payments under the clearing house program, and relevant government agencies, or as authorised or required by law.
To ensure that your business's employees are made aware of how we intend to use and disclose the information collected by the clearing house, we ask that you provide your business's employees with the following Employee privacy note.
The information you have provided to your employer will be used by the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House program to facilitate superannuation payments to you.
The collection of this information is authorised by the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
This information may be disclosed to the relevant super funds and financial institutions in relation to payments under the clearing house program and relevant government agencies, or as authorised or required by law.
While it is not compulsory for you to provide your tax file number (TFN) to your super fund, if you choose not to:
your super fund may have to pay extra income tax on contributions your employer makes for you (including salary sacrifice) and may take this extra money out of your super account
your super fund may not be able to accept some contributions
you may miss out on super co-contributions even if otherwise eligible.
The information you provide to the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House will be used for the purpose of administering the clearing house.",https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/how-to-pay-super/small-business-superannuation-clearing-house/clearing-house-privacy/
5,Missed and late super guarantee payments,"What to do if you are an employer and do not pay an employee's super guarantee (SG) on time or to the right fund.
If you do not pay an employee's super guarantee (SG) to the right super fund on or before the due date you must:
lodge a superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) statement
pay the super guarantee charge.
If an employee believes their SG obligations have not been met, they can contact us and make an employee notification (EN). We review all notifications and will pursue outstanding amounts where we find a discrepancy. We will work with you if you are unable to pay in full to establish a payment plan.
We may also notify other employees about potential SG owed. We can take firmer action to pursue outstanding debts, including the commencement of legal proceedings to recover an amount owed.
Your employee's super contribution is only considered 'paid' on the date it's received by the super fund. If you are using a clearing house, payments made to the clearing house that are not processed, or do not reach the super fund until after the payment due date, are considered late payments.
Processing times vary between clearing houses. You must check the processing timeframes required by your clearing house to ensure your payments will be processed before the payment due dates.
Example: missed super guarantee payments
Teddy owns and runs a novelty store and usually pays super for eligible employees on time. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Teddy misses paying super to his employees’ funds for the SG quarterly due date of 28 April (for the quarter ending 31 March).
Teddy knows that the SG quarterly due date cannot be extended by law. He knows that to avoid penalties, he must lodge an SGC statement (NAT 9599) within a month of the quarterly due date (in this case, by 28 May) and pay the SGC to the ATO for the outstanding super he owes.
Teddy cannot pay the SGC in full but lodges his SGC statement through Online services for business by the due date to avoid additional penalties. He also sets up a flexible payment plan.
End of example
If you have made a late super guarantee payment to an employee's super fund, you may be able to use it to:
Offset the shortfall and nominal interest components of the SGC
pay super in the current quarter
put the payment towards future super payments (limited to a period no more than 12 months from the beginning of the quarter).
You can offset late payments against the SGC if you have:
made the payment to your employee's super fund
made the payment before the date your original SGC assessment was made
lodged your late payment offset election in the SGC statement through Online services for business within 4 years of your original SGC assessment date
advised us of the date of late payment to your employee's super fund.
Offset late super payments against the SGC:
are not tax-deductible
cannot be used as a contribution for the current quarter or future quarter's super contributions.
For quarters beginning on or after 1 January 2020, a salary-sacrificed contribution cannot be offset against the SGC.
Note: A nomination to offset late payments is binding and cannot be changed. If you choose to have the contributions offset against the SGC, you cannot withdraw this choice.
To lodge a late payment offset election, use the SGC statement (NAT 9599). Lodge through Online services for business:
attach the SGC statement Excel spreadsheet to a new secure mail message
select Superannuation as the topic
select Lodge SGC statement as the subject.
To advise of late payments:
attach evidence of the late payment (or payments) in a separate secure mail message
select Superannuation as the topic
select Other as the subject.
If you are unable to lodge online, phone us on 13 10 20 for other options.
Example: late super guarantee payment offset
Charles meant to contribute to his employee's super fund by 28 April for the quarter ending 31 March. However, he made his payment late to the fund on 1 July.
Charles made his payment after the quarterly due date of 28 April. Because of the late payment, Charles is still required to lodge an SGC statement. Charles lodges an SGC statement through Online services for business on 10 July.
When he lodges his SGC statement, Charles can elect to claim the late super payment offset, which will reduce the SG shortfall and nominal interest of the SGC. Charles then pays the remaining SGC and sends evidence of the late payments through Online services for business.
End of example
You can carry forward a late SG payment if:
it's for the same employee
the start of the carried forward quarter is within 12 months after the payment date.
If you carry forward a late super payment, it is only tax-deductible in the year it's received by the super fund.
Example: late super guarantee payment carried forward
Hannah makes a late super payment for her employee on 5 November, missing the quarterly due date of 28 October.
As Hannah has missed the due date, she must lodge an SGC statement and pay the SGC.
Hannah decides to carry forward the late payment made on 5 November. She uses it towards the employee super for the quarter, ending 30 March in the following year. Hannah can do this because the payment is for both:

the same employee
a quarter in the 12 months following the date she paid it.

End of example
Our SG compliance approach supports employers that engage with us and want to get things right.
We may contact an employer by phone, email or letter:
if we receive an employee notification
if we detect they have not paid their SG on time and the due date has passed
if we detect they have not paid the right amount of SG for one or more of their employees
reminding them of the requirement to lodge an SGC statement.
If an employer receives a contact letter or email and believes they have paid in full and on time to the employee's super fund:
they should review their records to ensure they have met their obligations in full
they do not need to contact us.
We conduct additional checks before taking firmer action for employers unwilling to meet SG obligations. In some cases, we will:
undertake an SG audit of an employer
raise SGC assessments with additional penalties for not lodging the statement by the due date.
If you're unsure what action to take for your situation, you can phone us on 13 10 20.
If you are having trouble meeting your SG obligations, you should make a voluntary disclosure by completing and lodging an SGC statement (NAT 9599) by its due date, even if you cannot pay it in full.
We are unable to provide extensions to lodge SGC statements past the due date. Nominal interest will be calculated until the lodgment date of the SGC statement. We encourage you to lodge as soon as possible, to minimise nominal interest.
If you are experiencing difficulties lodging, phone us on 13 10 20 to discuss your circumstances.
If you do not lodge the SGC statement by the due date, a Part 7 penalty will apply.
We are more likely to reduce or waive the penalty if you:
make a genuine attempt to meet SG obligations
have a good compliance history.
For example, we may reduce a penalty for an employer who lodged an SGC statement after the relevant due date, but before being notified of ATO compliance action.
If you do not lodge an SGC statement before audit action has started, a greater Part 7 penalty can apply. This could be up to 200% of the SGC.
We can also help you:
complete an SGC statement
work out a payment plan when you are unable to pay on time
understand your super guarantee obligations through our voluntary online Super guarantee employer obligations course.
If you're unable to make a quarterly super contribution because you are affected by a disaster, we can help.
We will take stronger compliance action – including imposing additional penalties – if you do not:
engage with us promptly by replying to our correspondence
take steps to resolve your outstanding super guarantee obligations.
We may also issue:
an SGC liability estimate
a garnishee notice
a director penalty notice
a direction to pay SGC
an education direction to complete the Super guarantee employer obligations course.
We take this approach with employers who:
repeatedly do not pay the correct amount of super guarantee
make it difficult for us to determine an SGC liability
repeatedly fail to keep appointments
repeatedly fail to supply information without an acceptable reason
deliberately supply information that is irrelevant, inadequate or misleading
engage in any behaviour to delay the supply of information.

6,Super guarantee charge amendments or objections,"When we receive your superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) statement, it is an assessment made on that date. You can request an amendment or object to an assessment.
You can ask for an amendment to your assessment within 4 years of the date it was made. You must provide copies of all supporting documentation with your amendment request.
You can object to your assessment within 60 days of the date it was made.
If you do not agree with our assessment, you must:
object to a decision in writing by responding to all criteria
sign your statement (or have an authorised representative sign it)
provide us with copies of evidence supporting your objection.
You must still pay the super guarantee charge (SGC) even if you object or request an amendment. If your amendment and/or objection request is successful, we will refund any overpayment.
If you do not pay the SGC, a general interest charge (GIC) will apply until either the outstanding debt is paid, or you successfully request a reduction. The law does not allow you to object to the GIC. However, you can ask us to reduce it if your situation is exceptional, meaning a much higher standard than unusual.
If your objection is not allowed in full, you can:
apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review
appeal to the Federal Court against the decision.
You will need to go to your relevant state Tribunal or Court website for applications and pay the fee. You must do this within 60 days of receipt of the objection decision.
If you're found liable for a super guarantee charge or penalty, you are entitled to amend or object to an assessment.",https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/missed-and-late-super-guarantee-payments/the-super-guarantee-charge/super-guarantee-charge-amendments-or-objections/

8,Work out if you have to pay super,"Work out when employers need to pay super guarantee and which employees are eligible.
If you pay a worker, you are also required to pay them super guarantee:
Amount of pay – you pay it regardless of how much they are paid – their earnings amount is not relevant.
Employee age – for employees who are  
18 years or older, you pay it regardless of how many hours they work
under 18 years old, you pay it if they work more than 30 hours in a week.













 
Rate – the super guarantee rate is 11%.
What it is calculated on – if you  
pay on time, use their ordinary time earnings (OTE) to work out the minimum contribution (OTE is the amount you pay employees for their ordinary hours of work
miss it or make a late payment, use their salary and wages to work out how much super guarantee and super guarantee charge to pay.
You can use the eligibility tool to work out if you have to pay super for a worker.
Super guarantee eligibility tool
Before 1 July 2022, you did not have to pay super guarantee for a worker earning less than $450 a month. You now have to pay regardless of their earnings.
If you are making a payment after 30 June 2022 for work done before 1 July 2022, you work out the amount of super guarantee based on when they are paid, not when they earned the income.
This means if you pay an eligible employee on or after 1 July 2022, you will need to pay their super regardless of how much they have earned, even if some of the pay period it relates to is before 1 July 2022.
Generally, all employees are eligible for super guarantee. It doesn't matter if the employee is:
full time, part time or casual
receiving a super pension or annuity while working (this includes employees on transition to retirement)
a temporary resident, such as a backpacker
a company director
a family member working in your business.
There are additional eligibility rules for:
employees under 18
domestic or private workers
contractors
international workers
self-employed people
high income earners who opt out of super.
Example: occasional employers
Each summer, Samir – a 32-year-old seasonal fruit picker – works at the ABC produce farm. He usually works 15 hours a month for 3 months, earning $435 a month before tax.
In 2022, Samir wasn't eligible for super guarantee as he didn't earn more than $450 in a month.
In 2023, Samir is eligible for super guarantee, which his employer pays at 11% of his ordinary time earnings.
End of example
You must pay super guarantee on payments you make to an employee under 18 years old if they work for you more than 30 hours in a week, regardless of how much you pay them. Their earnings amount is not relevant.
As discussed in Superannuation Guarantee Determination SGD 93/1, the number of hours worked is the actual number of hours the employee works in that week. You can't average the hours across fortnightly or monthly pay periods.
Example: under 18 years old and working different hours a week
Lily is 17 years old and has 2 jobs – working at a hardware shop and a local café.
From 20 to 24 June 2022, Lily worked 32 hours at the shop and earned $800 before tax. Her employer pays her on 2 July 2022.
Lily also works 6 hours a month in the café, earning $150.
As Lily has worked:

more than 30 hours in one week in the hardware store, this employer pays her super guarantee for this week
not more than 30 hours in a week in her job as a barista, this employer doesn't pay her super guarantee for this work.

End of example
A domestic or private worker does work:
relating personally to you (not to a business of yours)
relating to your home, household affairs or family – such as a nanny, housekeeper or carer.
You must pay super guarantee on payments you make to domestic or private workers if they work for you more than 30 hours in a week, regardless of how much you pay them. Their earnings amount is not relevant.
You may also have to pay super guarantee for a domestic worker or carer if the following both apply:
You have a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) plan that you manage yourself.
You use your funds to hire a carer or other domestic worker.
You must pay super for contractors if you pay them mainly for their labour. This is the case even if they quote an Australian business number (ABN).
Their earnings amount is not relevant.
Your worker is eligible for super guarantee even if they are a temporary resident, such as a backpacker or a working holiday maker.
If you send an Australian employee to work temporarily in another country, you must continue to pay super contributions for them in Australia.
If you have employees working overseas, you can apply for a certificate of coverage so you don't have to pay super in the other country as well.
However, you do not have to pay super for:
non-resident employees who work outside Australia
some foreign executives who hold certain visas or entry permits (phone us on 13 10 20 for information)
employees temporarily working in Australia who are covered by a bilateral super agreement – you must keep a copy of the employee’s certificate of coverage to prove the exemption.
If you’re a non-resident employer, you do not have to pay super for resident employees for work they do outside Australia.
If you're self-employed as a sole trader or in a partnership, you do not have to pay super guarantee for yourself.
You do not have to pay super guarantee for members of the army, naval or air force reserve for work carried out in that role.
You do not have to pay super guarantee for high-income earners working for multiple employers who ask you not to pay it to them.
You must have an SG employer shortfall exemption certificate for the employee. We will send you the certificate after the employee has applied to us to opt out.

10,How to report reportable super contributions,"Reportable super contributions can be reported to us online through Single Touch Payroll (STP) or through a payment summary annual report.
Reporting online through Single Touch Payroll (STP) is the way of reporting and finalising extra super contributions for your employees. If you choose not to report these amounts through STP, you must give payment summaries to your employees. You will need to submit a payment summary annual report to the ATO covering these amounts.
All employers must report salary sacrificed amounts that would have constituted ordinary time earnings (OTE) or salary and wages.
You can work out how to report with the STP reporting checklist.
When issuing your employees with their annual payment summaries, you must include any reportable employer super contributions. Do this at the label Reportable employer superannuation contributions.
Reportable employer super contributions are reported for the income year related to the contributions. This may be different to the year in which they are received by the super fund.
If you make reportable employer super contributions to an employee, you must provide them with an income statement or payment summary. You must do this even if you have not paid them salary or wages.
Super guarantee amounts or other compulsory contributions on payment summaries.
Example: reporting year
Pieter and his employer, ABC Pty Ltd, have an agreement that ABC contributes $1,200 per month to Pieter’s super fund. Of this amount, $725 is a salary sacrificed amount and $475 is the compulsory super guarantee payment.
For the 2015–16 income year, ABC makes its employer contributions to Pieter's super fund. This is made on the 28th day after the end of the month in which the sacrificed income was withheld. This means the last payment (for the month of June) is made on 28 July 2016.
Reportable employer super contributions are reported for the year they accrued, not the year they were paid. Therefore, all the 2015–16 contributions are included. This is the case even though the last contribution was actually paid in the 2016–17 financial year.
At the end of the income year, ABC includes $8,700 on Pieter’s payment summary as reportable employer super contributions:



Employer contributions ($1,200 × 12)

$14,400



Less Pieter’s super guarantee entitlement ($475 × 12)

−$5,700



Reportable employer super contributions

$8,700




The super guarantee amount of $5,700 is not included anywhere on the payment summary.

11,Employers affected by disasters,"We can help you if disasters make it difficult to pay super guarantee contributions for your employees on time.
Phone us as soon as possible on 13 10 20 if you're unable to make your quarterly super contributions by the due date because you are either:
impacted by a natural disaster
located in a disaster-affected area.
By law, we cannot extend the due date to pay the super guarantee charge (SGC). You will still need to both:
lodge a Superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) statement
pay the SGC if you did not make contributions to a super fund on time.
We can talk to you about a payment plan if you need it.
If your records are lost or damaged in a disaster, you can make an estimate of super guarantee contributions using old records. You could get these records from:
your employees
your bank
the super funds you pay contributions to
records of PAYG payments you've made.
Make sure your employees understand how you are going to calculate their super payments using an estimate.
If you are closing down your business because of a disaster, you still need to pay your employees' super obligations.

12,List of payments that are ordinary time earnings,"Use this list to work out which payments count as ordinary time earnings (OTE) or salary and wages for super guarantee.
As an employer, you use:
OTE to work out the minimum super guarantee contribution for your employees. OTE is the amount you pay employees for their ordinary hours of work, including things like commissions and shift loadings.
salary and wages to work out the super guarantee charge. You only need to do this if you missed paying the minimum super guarantee contribution by the due date. Salary and wages are similar to OTE but also includes any overtime payments.

Example: overtime identified in award or agreement
Ennio is employed under a collective agreement that incorporates terms from an award. If there's inconsistency between the agreement and the award, the agreement prevails.
Under the award, the ordinary hours of work are 38 hours per week and the employer can require an employee to work reasonable overtime. However, the agreement provides for a shift roster in which employees work an average of 44 hours per week. The shift roster identifies the ordinary hours of work as 40 hours, with the additional four hours paid at a penalty rate.
The payment to Ennio for his 40 ordinary hours of work is OTE. The 4 hours of overtime payments are not OTE.
The payment for all 44 hours is salary or wages because it is a reward for his services.
End of example

Example: ordinary hours of work not stated
Kim works in a call centre. Under her contract she works a minimum number of hours per week. She also works extra shifts when needed, though there is no clear pattern to this.
There is no award or agreement that specifies Kim's ordinary hours of work, and she is not paid overtime rates for her extra shifts.
All of Kim's wages are OTE. As there are no stipulated ordinary hours of work, and no pattern of regular or usual hours, Kim's ordinary hours of work are all the hours she actually works.
All the payments to Kim are also salary or wages.
End of example

Example: piece-rates where no ordinary hours stated
Evan works as a fruit picker for Green Apples Ltd. He is paid 15 cents for every kilogram of apples he picks. There are no ordinary hours specified in any award or agreement.
Evan picks 5,000 kilograms of apples in his working hours in the week and is paid $750 by Green Apples Ltd.
The $750 paid to Evan is OTE. As his ordinary hours of work are not specified in any award or agreement, his ordinary hours of work are the hours that he actually works.
The $750 paid to Evan is also salary or wages.
End of example

Example: expense allowance expected to be used in full
Matteo is a salesman. In addition to his usual salary, he is paid $300 per month to cover expenses he is expected to incur while visiting clients, such as travel and mobile phone expenses. It is expected that Matteo will use the whole allowance in the course of visiting clients.
The $300 allowance is not OTE or salary or wages because it is not a reward for Matteo's services.

Example: reimbursement
Fernando travels by train on behalf of his employer and pays for the train ticket himself. He provides a receipt to his employer for the $14.50 cost of the train ticket, and the employer reimburses him $14.50.

13,Super payment due dates,"An employee's fund must receive their super payments on or before the quarterly super due dates.
You must pay super for eligible employees. To avoid the super guarantee charge (SGC), payments must be received by the employee's fund on or before the quarterly super due dates.
Payments can be made at least 4 times a year. This applies from the day employees start working for you. Payment due dates occur quarterly.

When a super due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, your contribution must be received by the fund on or before the next business day.
You can also make payments more frequently than quarterly, for example fortnightly or monthly. If you do, ensure you pay your total super guarantee (SG) contribution for the quarter by the due date.
If you have missed the quarterly payment due date or made late super payments, you will need to lodge a SGC statement and pay the SGC to us. The missed or late super payments are no longer tax deductible.
A clearing house distributes super contributions to your employees' funds on your behalf.
SG payments made to a commercial clearing house before the SG due date may not reach the super fund until after the due date.
Your employee's super contribution is only considered 'paid' on the date it's received by the super fund. Not the date it's received by the clearing house.
Note: It's important that you leave enough time for your SG payments to reach the super fund and allow for their processing timeframes.
However, if you use the ATO's Small Business Superannuation Clearing House, payments may be considered 'paid' on the date they're received.
Check the processing timeframes required by your clearing house to ensure your payments will be processed before the payment due dates.
Some super funds, awards and contracts require you to pay super more regularly than quarterly.
Meeting the SG contribution payment dates does not ensure compliance with other super funds, awards and contracts.
You should check the contractual obligations you have with your super fund, award or contract to ensure super contributions are paid on time.

14,Superannuation on annual leave loading,"Annual leave loading is included in ordinary time earnings (OTE) unless it is clearly linked to lost overtime.
Annual leave loading is an extra payment that may be paid to an employee on top of their base rate during periods of annual leave.
As an employer, you work out super guarantee payments for your employees based on their OTE. OTE includes annual leave pay but not overtime.
Generally, you include annual leave loading in OTE because it's related to annual leave. However, you don't include annual leave loading in OTE if you can show that it's paid to compensate employees for being unable to work overtime while on leave.
If this is your situation, this page explains the evidence you will need.
To omit annual leave loading from your employees' OTE, you need written evidence showing that the leave loading is linked to a lost opportunity to work overtime.
This evidence can be either:
the relevant award or agreement
a documented policy, understood by you and your employees, that states the reason for the leave loading entitlement.
If you don't have written evidence, you need to either:
obtain it as soon as possible
start including annual leave loading in your employees' OTE when working out their super guarantee payments.
If you obtain written evidence as soon as possible, we won't review how you treated annual leave loading in previous quarters.
Example: documenting the reason for annual leave loading
QWERTY Co has a mix of day workers and shift workers, who are all covered by a modern award.
For day workers, the award includes an entitlement to annual leave loading and paid overtime. However, the award does not clearly link overtime and annual leave loading.
For shift workers, the award has a different annual leave loading entitlement and no paid overtime. The award indicates that this annual leave loading compensates shift workers for the lost opportunity to earn shift allowances while on leave.
QWERTY Co believes the day workers are paid annual leave loading to compensate for the lost opportunity to work overtime while on leave. This is based on advice the company has received about the historical reasons for the annual leave loading.
QWERTY Co prepares a policy document that clarifies the reason for annual leave loading. It includes the following paragraph:
The entitlement to annual leave loading under clause [X] is compensating for the lost opportunity for overtime, except where [the award] indicates otherwise.
QWERTY Co regularly deals with a union representing its workers. The company provides a copy of the policy document to the union to ensure it reflects their understanding of the reason for annual leave loading.
When working out super guarantee for its workers, QWERTY Co self-assesses the annual leave loading as:

excluded from OTE for day workers
included in OTE for shift workers.

End of example
We understand that some employers have been unsure how to correctly treat annual leave loading. Also, you may not have evidence that identifies the purpose of annual leave loading paid in previous quarters.
We won't review how you've treated annual leave loading in previous quarters if both of the following apply:
you self-assessed that annual leave loading was not OTE because it was for a loss of opportunity to work overtime
there is no evidence that the annual leave loading was for something other than overtime.
However, if there is evidence that the annual leave loading was for something other than overtime, then the loading should have been included in OTE. In this case you have a super guarantee shortfall. You will need to lodge a super guarantee charge (SGC) statement with us and pay the shortfall.
We cannot waive any of the components of the SGC, including interest and administration fees. However, we can reduce the additional penalties, considering:
the uncertainty and practical difficulties employers have faced in this area
the fact that you voluntarily lodged an SGC statement.

16,Expanding the use of Single Touch Payroll data,"See how we are expanding our use of Single Touch Payroll data to improve compliance.
One of our key focus areas in the ATO corporate plan 2022–23 is to expand the use of Single Touch Payroll (STP) data. This work will enable us to create a view of employees' superannuation guarantee (SG) data provided by all super funds and employers in one place. By doing so, we can follow up employer non-compliance more proactively.
We are building on our use of STP by matching data from super funds with the amounts reported by employers through STP for each employee–employer relationship.
While we already use these data sets, this new approach will provide us with an improved ability to identify a range of behaviours that drive non-compliance. We can tailor our interventions for the behaviours we see, including late payment, underpayment, and non-payment of super guarantee.
We will be able to:
contact employers who are not meeting their obligations earlier, with improved messaging
identify trends of incorrect reporting or issues related to information reported
take action to help employers and funds to get it right
improve any systemic data quality issues.
Most importantly, we will continue our existing compliance approach of supporting employers to understand their obligations and taking action to correct issues when mistakes occur. Employers can also expect to see some new SG compliance treatments as this work matures.
STP data is now a critical component of the tax and superannuation systems and is being used in real time for several purposes. That’s why it’s more important than ever to:
keep good records – this is not only a legal requirement, but it also makes good business sense. It allows you as an employer to make sure that what you report is correct
ensure your reporting and payments are timely and accurate. If you find that you make a mistake, take action to correct it as soon as you notice it. This will mean that we don’t contact you unnecessarily
understand and meet your payroll obligations
remember that SG payments need to be received by the employee's super fund on or before the due date. If you use an intermediary to make your super payments, like a commercial clearing house, it may take longer for the payment to get to the employee's account. Ensure you know how long this takes, so it is not late
check that your payments are SuperStream compliant. SuperStream is the way employers must pay SG contributions to funds

17,Superannuation guarantee amnesty,"The super guarantee amnesty ended 7 September 2020.
Background
Outcomes of the SG amnesty
Payment plans
Amnesty disqualifications
Missed and late super guarantee payments
The superannuation guarantee (SG) amnesty ended on 7 September 2020 and provided employers who had fallen behind with SG obligations for their workers, with an opportunity to catch up on these payments without having to pay the administrative component or the Part 7 penalties of the SG charge.
The SG amnesty covered periods from 1 July 1992 to 31 March 2018.
Around 28,300 employers qualified for the amnesty, disclosing around $911.5 million.
The amnesty resulted in the allocation of over $850 million to super funds, benefitting the retirement savings of more than 692,200 employees.
Over 70% of the employers who qualified for the amnesty were small businesses with an annual turnover less than $2 million.
Businesses with a turnover greater than $250 million accounted for 3% of eligible employers.
The top five industries, accounting for around 55% of employers who qualified for the amnesty and 45% of the amounts disclosed were:
construction
retail trade
professional scientific and technical services
accommodation and food services
other services.
If you entered a payment plan as a result of the amnesty, to remain eligible, you must either:
pay the SGC amount disclosed in the amnesty application form in full to us
continue to meet each ongoing instalment under your payment plan to pay the SGC amount owing.
If you need further assistance managing your tax and super obligations:
speak with a trusted tax adviser
see Help with paying.
If you're unable to maintain payments, the law requires us to disqualify you from the amnesty and remove the amnesty benefits for any unpaid quarters.
If your disclosure is disqualified from the amnesty, we will:
notify you in writing of the quarters you are disqualified for
charge you the administration component of $20 per employee included in the disqualified quarter
consider your circumstances when deciding whether the Part 7 penalty should be remitted
issue a notice of amended assessment with the increased amount owing
work with you through our debt processes to collect the amount outstanding.
Any payments you make for a disqualified quarter will not be tax deductible.
If you do not pay an employee's super guarantee (SG) on time, in full, or to the right super fund, you must:
lodge a superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) statement
pay the super guarantee charge.
If you fail to lodge an SGC statement, you will be liable for a Part 7 penalty, which can be up to 200% of the SGC amount payable.

If a due date falls on a weekend or public holiday, you can make the payment and lodge the SGC statement on the next business day.
The SGC includes:
the SG shortfall, made up of  
SG calculated on salary and wages (including any overtime)
any choice liability, based on the shortfall and capped at $500




 
nominal interest of 10% per annum (accrues from the start of the relevant quarter)
an administration fee of $20 per employee, per quarter.

Super payment due dates occur quarterly. To avoid paying the SGC, you must pay on time.
If you cannot pay by the due date, you still need to lodge the SGC statement on time.
When you lodge on time, you can access our support services that provide help with paying. If you can't pay in full, but you lodge by the due date, you may be able to set-up a payment plan to pay in instalments.
If you miss a due date, interest for paying super will accrue until you lodge your SGC statement. Nominal interest is part of the SGC and, by law, cannot be reduced or waived.
If you request an extension of time to lodge an SGC statement, the general interest charge (GIC) applies from the deferred payment request until the SGC is paid in full.
You must make the request before the due date by either:
writing to us and stating why you need an extension
phoning us on 13 10 20.
We prioritise the collection of unpaid SGC debts. We'll work with you to address outstanding amounts but if you don't engage with us we'll take stronger action which can include additional penalties.
If an employee reports you for unpaid super, we'll start an investigation on their behalf. We'll keep them informed of the investigation and the progress of our debt recovery actions.
If we find or reasonably suspect that you haven't met your obligations, we may inform all your affected employees and any former employees of any SG shortfall.

20,Super for contractors,"Find out if you need to pay superannuation for contractors, about offering choice of fund and how much to pay.
If you pay contractors mainly for their labour, they are employees for superannuation guarantee (SG) purposes. You may need to pay super to a fund for them.
It doesn't matter if the contractor has an Australian business number (ABN).
Make super contributions for contractors if you pay them:
under a verbal or written contract that is mainly for their labour (more than half the dollar value of the contract is for their labour)
for their personal labour and skills (payment isn't dependent on achieving a specified result)
to perform the contract work (work cannot be delegated to someone else).
Example: employee for super guarantee purposes, not contractor
David's Caravan Park has a contract with Amanda, a freelance administrative assistant, to answer phones and do administrative work for 15 hours per week.
The contract specifies that Amanda herself must perform the work. Amanda has an ABN and invoices David's Caravan Park weekly for the hours she works. Amanda is an employee for SG purposes because:

her contract is wholly for the labour and skills she provides
she is paid according to the number of hours worked
she performs the work herself.

David's Caravan Park needs to pay SG contributions for Amanda in addition to her pay. Prior to 1 July 2022, Amanda would have needed to have been paid at least $450 in a calendar month to be eligible for SG.
End of example
If you enter into a contract with a company, trust or partnership, you do not have to pay super for the person they employ to do the work.
Example: contractor, not employee for super guarantee purposes
Harry's Hobby Shop wants to paint their new shop. They contract Pete's Paints for the job. The entire job is completed by one painter from Pete's Paints.

The contract is between Harry's Hobby Shop and Pete's Paints.
Harry's Hobby Shop paid Pete's Paints to achieve a result.
The painter is not an employee of Harry's Hobby Shop for SG purposes.

Harry's Hobby Shop does not have any SG obligations for the painter or Pete's Paints. This is the case even if Pete is a sole trader and does the work himself, because he was contracted to achieve a result.
Pete's Paints may have SG obligations for the painter.
End of example
If you need further help:
refer to employee or contractor to help you work out if a contractor is an employee for super purposes
use the superannuation guarantee eligibility decision tool to work out if they're entitled to super guarantee contributions.
If your contractor is an employee for SG purposes and entitled to receive SG contributions, they are generally eligible to choose their own super fund. You must offer eligible contractors a choice of super fund within 28 days of their start date.
If your contractor is eligible to choose a super fund but doesn't, then to avoid penalties you must request their stapled super fund details from us.
The minimum super you must pay is the super guarantee percentage of the worker's ordinary time earnings. This is the labour component of the contract. Do not include:
any contract payments that are for material and equipment
overtime for which the worker was paid overtime rates
GST.
If the values of the different parts of the contract aren't detailed in the contract, we'll accept their market values. We'll consider normal industry practices. If you cannot work out the labour part of the contract, you can use a reasonable market value of the labour section.
Paying an additional amount equal to the SG rate to the contractor on top of their usual pay does not count as a super contribution. To avoid the super guarantee charge, you must make the SG contribution to the contractor's super fund each quarter.

21,Setting up super for your business,"As an employer, you need to set up your business to pay super into your eligible employees' chosen super funds or their stapled super fund where no choice has been made.
If your employee hasn’t made a choice and doesn’t have a stapled super fund, you can contribute their super to your default super fund.
What you need to do:
Select your default super fund.
Offer employees a choice of super fund and keep records that show you've done this.
Request your employee’s stapled super fund details if they do not make a choice
Provide employees' TFNs to their funds.
Set up your systems to pay super contributions electronically to the right fund.
If you pay extra super for an employee:
under a salary sacrifice agreement, see How to set up salary sacrifice for super

22,How to set up salary sacrifice for super,"Employers can set up a salary sacrifice for super arrangement with their employee to get the benefits of a salary sacrifice.
Salary sacrificing changes
From 1 January 2020, you are required to pay super guarantee on your employee's ordinary time earnings (OTE) base.
The OTE base includes any amounts that would have been OTE had they not been salary sacrificed. You can't use the reduced salary.
This means salary sacrifice can't be used to reduce OTE and can't be counted as a contribution for super guarantee purposes.
End of example
You benefit because the amount sacrificed is:
not a fringe benefit and not subject to fringe benefits tax
tax deductible.
Your employee benefits because the salary-sacrificed amount is:
not declared as assessable income
not subject to PAYG tax
taxed in the super fund at the concessional rate of 15%, which is usually less than the PAYG tax rate.
There is no limit to how much super employees can contribute each year. However, if the cap is exceeded, they may need to pay extra tax.
To create an effective salary sacrifice arrangement, you must:
set up the arrangement for employees' future earnings
document the arrangement
use a complying fund.
The arrangement must be set up for your employee's future earnings. It can't include previously earned or accrued:
salary, wages or entitlements
annual or long service leave.
You and your employee must prepare and sign a document that states the terms of the salary sacrifice arrangement. If you don't have this documentation, it may be difficult to establish the facts of your arrangement.
Employees can renegotiate the arrangement at any time, within the terms of their employment contract or industrial agreement. If your employee has a renewable contract, you can renegotiate the salary sacrifice amount before the start of each renewal.
The salary sacrifice amount must be contributed to a complying fund for the period of the arrangement.
Contributions can't be accessed until the employee satisfies a condition of release, such as reaching retirement age.
If the arrangement is not effective, super contributions made under the arrangement are:
considered a payment of salary or wages
considered a personal contribution, not an employer contribution
counted towards the employee's non-concessional contributions cap.
This means:
the contributions are included in your employee's assessable income and subject to PAYG withholding tax
you are not entitled to a tax deduction for the sacrificed amount
your employee will be subject to excess non-concessional contributions tax (if they exceed the cap).
When you report online through Single Touch Payroll (STP), the amount will automatically appear on the income statement. You don't need to provide a payment summary.
When you enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement, you need to keep relevant records for 5 years, including:
copies of the arrangement
evidence of any expenses.
Contributions to an employee's super fund made under an effective salary sacrifice arrangement are considered deductions.
As an employer, you have obligations under the Fair Work Act 2009 for deductions made from an employee’s wages.
You can only deduct money for a salary sacrifice if:
you document the arrangement, and the employee agrees in writing to a deduction from their wages
the deduction  
is for the employee's benefit
complies with the employee’s enterprise agreement
is allowed by a law, a court order, the Fair Work CommissionExternal Link or an employee’s award.
You can claim a tax deduction for salary sacrifice contributionsExternal Link for your employees if you meet all 3 conditions:
The contributions are made under an effective salary sacrifice arrangement.
The contributions are made to a complying super fund.
The employee is under 75 years old. In some situations, you can claim for older employees.
You can only claim a deduction for a salary sacrifice contribution in the financial year the super fund receives it.
Example: super fund receives payment after financial year

Sally pays her employee's super contribution to the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House on 30 June 2020.
The super fund receives the contribution on 3 July 2020.
Sally can't claim a tax deduction in the 2019–20 financial year. She can claim the deduction for the 2020–21 financial year. This is the year the super fund received the contribution.

End of example
There's no limit to how much employees can salary sacrifice (unless there's a limit in their employment contract or agreement). If their contributions exceed their concessional contributions cap, they will pay more tax.
Your employee needs to consider:
whether the amount salary sacrificed together with their super guarantee contributions will exceed their concessional contributions cap
how excess contributions will affect their tax.
When setting up salary sacrifice arrangements, you should tell your employee:
when you will pay contributions
how they can adjust their contributions to stay under their contribution cap
to contact their fund to work out their contributions for the financial year.
Your employee can ask you to change the timing of their super contributions but not the employer contributions.
Salary sacrificed amounts are paid from pre-tax salary. This means they are part of the employee's concessional contributions for the financial year.
Contributions above the cap will mean they pay more tax.
Concessional contributions include:
employer contributions – such as super guarantee payments
salary sacrificed contributions.
If an employee has more than one super fund, all concessional contributions are combined. They are also counted towards their contributions cap.
Super contributions you make for an employee count towards their contribution caps in the financial year the super fund receives them. For example, if you pay June 2019 contributions in July, they will count towards the 2019–20 financial year.
The timing of your contributions can have consequences for your employee's contributions caps and tax. It could also have a consequence for the year you're entitled to a deduction. Make sure you leave enough time for the super fund to process your contributions.

23,Overdue super guarantee payment,"Why you should pay super guarantee on time as an employer and what to do if you do not pay by the due date.
If you do not pay an employee's minimum super guarantee amount on time and to the right fund, you must:
lodge a super guarantee charge (SGC) statement to us
pay the SGC to us.
The SGC is:
more than the super you would have otherwise paid
not tax deductible.
The due date for SGC payment and lodging the statement is one calendar month after the super guarantee due date.

For due dates that fall on a weekend or public holiday, you can make the payment and lodge the SGC statement on the next business day.
If you miss making a super guarantee payment on time and to the right fund, meet your legal obligations by:
lodging an SGC statement by the due date
paying the SGC to us.
The SGC is made up of:
super guarantee shortfall including
super calculated on salary and wages (including any overtime)
any choice liability, based on the shortfall and capped at $500



 
nominal interest of 10% per annum (accrues from the start of the relevant quarter)
an administration fee of $20 per employee, per quarter.
The easiest option to work out the SGC is to use the Super guarantee charge (SGC) statement.
There are 3 ways to lodge your SGC statement:
Complete the SGC statement spreadsheet and lodge using ATO online services.
Use the SGC calculator in ATO online services for individualsExternal Link or businessExternal Link – it will ask you questions and
work out if you need to pay the SGC for your employees and how much you need to pay
electronically lodge your SGC statement with us



 
Use the super guarantee charge statement and calculator tool – there are some things to know about this option
We don't recommend it as there is a higher chance for mistakes and it takes much longer to process.
If you decide to use it, it can help you work out if you need to pay the SGC for your employees, how much you need to pay, and it can create a PDF version of the SGC statement.
If you are a WPN holder without an ABN, enter 70707070707 into the ABN section to complete the SGC statement. Include a cover note quoting your WPN as a reference when you mail the completed statement.
Mail the statement to:
Australian Taxation OfficePO Box 3578ALBURY  NSW  2640
To pay your SGC you need a payment reference number (PRN).
If you have an SGC-related notice or payment slip from us for the same ABN or WPN, use that PRN to pay us.
In Online services for business and Online services for individuals, the PRN can be found at the:
print option on the SGC lodgment summary screen
accounts summary screen
payment screens for BPAY or Other payment methods.
If you need a new PRN, phone 1800 815 886 between 8:00 am and 6:00 pm, Monday to Friday. Make sure you have your ABN or WPN and contact details with you when you call.
When you have your PRN, you can pay us the SGC.

We have released our first annual statistical results for employer obligations relating to superannuation guarantee (SG) compliance and obligations.
These results provide key statistics and analysis for SG employer obligations, including ATO compliance actions undertaken for the 2021-22 financial year.
You can download a printable version in portable document format: Link to infographicThis link will download a file.
Definitions of terms we use when explaining our compliance activities and employer SG obligations.
Super guarantee – Super guarantee (SG) is the minimum amount you must pay to avoid the super guarantee charge. Super guarantee is currently 10.5% of an employee’s ordinary time earnings.
Super guarantee charge – The super guarantee charge (SGC) applies when you don’t pay the minimum amount of super guarantee (SG) for your eligible employees to the correct fund by the due date.
Part 7 penalties – You are liable for a Part 7 penalty if you lodge your SGC statement late, or fail to provide a statement or information when requested during an audit.
Highlights of the 2021–22 financial year include the following.
Employers are paying more than 94% of the SG they are required to, without intervention from us.
A total of $1,059 million in superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) liabilities was raised through SG voluntary disclosures and ATO compliance action. This includes the total amount of $1,125m raised from ATO compliance actions and employer disclosures of unpaid super, less adjustments for amendments and objections.
The ATO distributed $645.4 million of super entitlements to individuals or super fund accounts. This includes SG amounts collected for liabilities raised arising from employee complaints, ATO initiated compliance activities and employer voluntary disclosures.
The ATO finalised approximately 17,300 SG cases, resulting in around $550 million SGC liabilities and $215 million in part 7 penalties raised.
15,200 of those reviews were because of employee notification complaints raising $495 million in SGC liabilities.
2,100 of those reviews were because of other ATO initiated reviews raising $55 million in SGC liabilities.


 
Around 30,800 employers came forward to make a voluntary disclosure of unpaid super, resulting in around $360 million in SGC liabilities being raised.
Approximately 891,000 employers are reporting super obligations through Single Touch Payroll, employing approximately 13.6 million employees.
The ATO received 19,600 employee complaints of unpaid super. Not all employee complaints received require action to be undertaken.
Some are resolved through other ATO actions including:
complaints where super entitlements have been met and the employee withdraws their compliant
the ATO has already raised an assessment against the employer for late or unpaid superannuation
the employer has already lodged an SGC statement to correct their obligations, or
duplicate notifications received from employees added to an existing case for an employer.

25,Reportable employer super contribution types,"Employers should know the type of super contribution made on behalf of employees to determine if contributions are reportable or non-reportable.
are reportable super contributions under individual contracts. This is because the employee directly influenced the terms of the agreement
are not reportable under collectively negotiated industrial agreements. This is the case, even though it's triggered by an employee choice.
Example: matching contribution triggered by collective agreement
Rodger's employer is required under an industrial agreement to make an additional employer contribution for Rodger's benefit.
The agreement allows Rodger to elect to contribute 0%, 5% or 8% of his salary as a personal after-tax contribution.
His employer is required to contribute 9.5%, 11.5% or 13% respectively, based on Rodger's election under the industrial agreement.
Rodger elects to contribute 8% as a personal after-tax contribution. His employer contributes 13% super as the employer contribution.
None of the amounts the employer contributes are reportable employer super contributions. This is because the additional employer contributions are required under industrial agreement.
Additionally, none of Rodger's personal after-tax super contributions are reportable employer super contributions. This is because they are already included in Rodger's assessable income.
Summary

Under an industrial agreement, Rodger's employer makes additional employer contributions for Rodger's benefit.
None of the amounts the employer contributes are reportable employer super contributions.
None of Roger's personal after-tax super contributions are reportable employer super contributions.

End of example

Example: matching contributions triggered by an individual agreement
Charlotte negotiated an individual common law employment contract with her employer.
Under the contract, if she elects to make 5% personal super contributions her employer would match them with a 2% contribution. This is in addition to the amount her employer already contributes for Charlotte to comply with super guarantee obligations.
Charlotte decides to make a 5% after-tax contribution to super. This personal contribution is not a reportable employer super contribution because it's part of Charlotte's assessable income.
However, the additional 2% employer super contribution is reportable. This is because Charlotte had the capacity to influence the terms of the contract requiring her employer to make the additional contribution.
End of example
Employer super contributions to a defined benefit fund for employees with defined benefit interests are not reportable.
This is because the amount you must contribute for defined benefit members is decided by the fund's actuary, not your employee.
Extra contributions are reportable if your employee:
asks you to make extra contributions to their fund account from their pre-tax income
has an accumulation account in the defined benefit fund (or any other fund).
Example: contributions to a defined benefit fund
Indira works for a large company and is a member of a defined benefit super fund. The company makes contributions to the fund according to the fund rules. These employer contributions are worked out by the fund's actuary.
Indira has no influence over, or choice about, this amount. Therefore, it is not a reportable employer super contribution.
Indira can choose to contribute up to 5% extra from her pre-tax income and decides to do so. The extra contribution goes into her account within the defined benefit fund. This extra amount is a reportable employer super contribution and must be reported on Indira's payment summary or through STP. If reported through STP, the extra amount it included on the income statement.
End of example
Super contributions made by your employee from their after-tax (net) income are not reportable employer super contributions. These are considered the employee's personal super contributions. This is the case even if you deduct the amounts from your employee's take-home pay and forward the amount to their super fund on their behalf.
Example: contributions from after-tax income

Jo asks her employer to pay $50 a fortnight to her super fund from her after-tax pay.
Although Jo has directly influenced the amount of super paid on her behalf, the additional $50 is not a reportable employer super contribution because it comes from Jo's after-tax income.
The $50 payments are Jo's personal (member) contributions and are part of her assessable income.

it will be harder to keep track of your super.
You can choose to make personal super contributions from your after-tax income. For example, you can contribute directly from your bank account to your super fund.

employed under an award or industrial agreement that does not need super contributions
employed under an enterprise agreement or workplace determination made on or after 1 January 2021
not employed under any state award or industrial agreement – this includes contractors that are eligible employees for super purposes.
Existing eligible employees can change their choice of fund as often as they like. However, you only have to accept a new choice from them once in any 12-month period.
Your employee is not eligible to choose their super fund if:
their super fund undergoes a merger or acquisition
they're on a temporary working visa.
However, your employee has the right to ask you for a Standard choice form.
If you're not sure what award or industrial agreement covers your employee:
visit the Fair Work websiteExternal Link
phone the workplace relations department in your state or territory
check with your employer association.
You must provide eligible employees a Superannuation standard choice form within 28 days of their start date.
You must also provide one if:
your employee asks for one
you can't contribute to their chosen fund or it's no longer a complying fund
you change the employer-nominated fund into which you pay the employee's contributions.
You must provide your employee with details of your nominated default super fund. On the Standard choice form, this information goes in section C.
You don't have to use the form, but any alternative document must cover the same information. Your software provider should follow the ATO data specificationsExternal Link for the Superannuation standard choice form, which outlines which fields in the form are mandatory to be replicated in software.
Employees can complete pre-filled standard choice forms through ATO online services linked to myGovExternal Link. They will need to print out the summary of their choice and give it you.
You can give your employees information about choosing a fund, such as:
why they need to choose a super fund
the process of choosing a super fund
your obligations to pay super guarantee and provide a default fund
how they nominate their chosen fund.
You cannot provide recommendations or advice about super to your employees, unless you are licensed by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) to provide financial advice.
Examples of recommendations or advice include:
which super fund employees should choose
their level of super contributions
consolidating their super.
For more information on how you can communicate to your employees about superannuation choices without breaking the law, visit ASIC’s Communicating with employees about choice of superannuation fund: What you can and cannot doExternal Link.
If your employee would like further information about how they can find their super fund details and complete the choice form, encourage them to visit Getting your super started.
You must keep a copy of the completed form or ATO online printed summary for 5 years.
Your records must show:
how much super guarantee (SG) you paid for each employee and how it was calculated
that you offered each eligible employee a choice of super fund
details of employees who are not eligible for choice.
You do not need to send a copy of these records to us or to your employee's chosen super fund.
Once an employee tells you their choice of super fund, you have 2 months to start paying contributions into that fund. If you have received a choice of form from a new employee from 1 November 2021, and you must contribute before this time, if you don’t pay to the employee's choice fund, you should pay into their stapled super fund or your employer nominated account if the ATO advises you that they do not have a stapled super fund.
You may be penalised if you don't:
offer your eligible employees a choice of fund
pay their super to their chosen fund.
For employees who start before 1 November 2021, you must pay super to your employer-nominated fund (default fund) or another fund that meets the choice of fund rules by the due date, if your employees have not:
or cannot choose their own fund
provided information about their choice of fund by the time their super guarantee contributions are due.
From 1 November 2021, if you have new employees start you may have an extra step to take if they don’t choose a super fund. You may now need to request their ‘stapled super fund’ details from us.
A stapled super fund is an existing super account which is linked, or 'stapled', to an individual employee so that it follows them as they change jobs.
You will also need to request stapled super fund details for employees who aren't eligible to choose their own fund, including:
temporary residents
those covered by an enterprise agreement or workplace determination made before 1 January 2021.
You can pay into your default fund, or another fund that meets the choice of fund rules if:
your employee doesn’t choose a super fund
for new employees from 1 November 2021, we have advised you that they don’t have a stapled super fund.

Employers must offer eligible employees a choice of super fund and a standard super choice form.",https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/setting-up-super-for-your-business/offer-employees-a-choice-of-super-fund/
29,Select your default super fund,"As an employer, you must select a default super fund that you will pay your employee's super into if they:
Have not chosen a fund, and
do not have a stapled super fund.
Most employees can choose a super fund or they will have a stapled super fund.
You must have a nominated (default) super fund and pay your employees super into this fund if:
your employees do not choose a fund, or are not eligible to choose one, and
we advise you that your employees do not have a stapled super fund.
You don’t need to offer a choice of super fund to some employees, but you may still need to request their stapled super fund details before paying to your default fund.
This includes employees that are:
temporary residents
covered by an enterprise agreement or workplace determination made before 1 January 2021.
You give your employees the details of this fund in section C of the Standard choice form.
The super fund you nominate must:
be a complying fund (one that meets specific requirements and obligations under super law)
be registered by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and offer a MySuper product (these are cost-effective superannuation products with a basic set of features).
To confirm that a fund meets these requirements, you can:
contact the fund
check Superfund LookupExternal Link (our register of complying super funds).
Ensure you keep records confirming that your nominated fund offers a MySuper product.
It is illegal for a super fund to give benefits to employers as an incentive to use them as their default fund.
Example of incentives include:
corporate hospitality
free or discounted holidays
discounted rates on products or services.
If you think a fund is offering incentives to join, you can report it to ASICExternal Link.
However, it is not illegal for a super fund to give benefits to your employees as an incentive for them to choose their fund. These could include financial literacy seminars or preferential death benefits.

30,Super for employees working overseas – certificate of coverage,"Employers must pay super guarantee (SG) contributions for Australian employees working temporarily overseas. You can apply to us for a certificate of coverage, so you don't have to pay super in the other country as well.
Australia has bilateral social security agreements with some countries, allowing you to apply for a certificate of coverage. With this certificate, you don't have to pay super (or equivalent) in the other country.
It exempts Australian employers from their super obligations in the country where their employee is temporarily working. Australian employers must continue to pay SG contributions in Australia.
The certificate exempts non-Australian employers from paying super in Australia. We may ask to see a copy of the certificate. Without it, non-Australian employers must pay super in Australia (unless they meet an exemption).
Example: Australian employee working in the United States
Simone is an Australian resident working for one year in the United States (US). Under US law, Simone and her Australian employer must pay compulsory social security (covering super) contributions.
Simone's employer must also pay SG contributions for her in Australia.
The bilateral agreement between Australia and the US means that Simone's employer doesn't need to pay US social security contributions.
To receive the US exemption, Simone's employer must request a certificate of coverage from the ATO.
Her employer must continue to pay SG contributions in Australia.
End of example

Example: United States employee working in Australia
Mac is a US resident working temporarily in Australia. A certificate of coverage issued by the US allows his employer to pay contributions solely under the US system.
With the certificate, Mac's employer is exempt from paying super under Australia's SG law.
End of example
By applying for a certificate of coverage for your employee, you're declaring that you will:
continue to make the required Australian SG contributions on behalf of your employee. These contributions must be made while your employee is working overseas
keep records of the super paid on behalf of your employee.
We share information about certificates of coverage with authorities in the country your employee is working in.
If you fail to meet the above requirements, we will cancel the certificate and notify the relevant foreign authorities. A cancellation means that you or your employee will not be exempt from the super (or equivalent) obligations in the other country. This cancellation will apply for the period of the certificate. If you fail to pay super in Australia, you are liable to pay the SG charge to the ATO.
If you pay SG contributions to your employee's self-managed super fund (SMSF), you should ask your employee to check their SMSF management arrangements before they leave Australia.
Employees travelling overseas need to check their SMSF maintains its complying Australian super fund status. If the SMSF is no longer a complying fund, you must pay SG contributions for your employee to another fund the employee has nominated as their chosen fund. If the employee has not chosen another fund use your default fund.
Before you apply for a certificate of coverage, check the countries Australia has a bilateral social security agreement with.
Apply for the certificate of coverage before your employee leaves Australia.
We'll generally assess your application within 28 days. If your application is approved, a certificate of coverage will be issued to the nominated postal address within your application.

31,Super for long-distance drivers,"How to calculate super guarantee (SG) and ordinary time earnings for long-distance drivers.
There are 3 ways to calculate super for long-distance drivers. Ordinary time earnings (OTE) is defined the same as for other employees.
For drivers covered by the Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2020, ordinary hours of work are 38 hours per week. In some cases, ordinary hours may be determined as an average of up to 28 consecutive days.
Employers should seek advice if they are unsure on how to calculate the ordinary time earnings for their employees when multiple methods are involved in determining the ordinary hours earning base for super You can calculate super guarantee (SG) for long-distance drivers using one of 3 methods:
minimum-guaranteed-wage method – you can't use this method if the driver's wages are more than the minimum under one of the other 2 methods
hourly-driving-rate method
cents-per-kilometre method.
The examples below are based on the award. Employers should seek advice if the terms of their enterprise agreement vary from that of the award.
Example: minimum-guaranteed-wage method
Marge is a long-distance driver, Grade 6, working under the Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2020. The award stipulates a minimum guaranteed wage payment of $864.10 per week, regardless of how long Marge actually drives.
As Marge receives only this minimum payment under the award, during the July–September quarter of the 2022–23 financial year, her employer calculates her OTE using that amount:
Super guarantee:
= OTE × SG rate
= $864.10 × 10.5%
= $90.73 per week
End of example

Example: hourly-driving-rate method
Sean is a long-distance driver, Grade 6, working under the Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2021. He is paid under the hourly-driving-rate method.
The hourly driving rate of $33.70 for full-time employees includes 2 components:

an industry disability allowance of 1.3 times a base rate
an overtime allowance of 1.2 times a base rate.

Although the hourly rate includes a component referred to as an overtime allowance, the allowance is not deducted from the total when calculating OTE because the whole hourly driving rate is paid for what are defined to be ordinary hours of work (except where the hours worked exceed 38 hours).
Sean has worked his ordinary hours of 38 hours in each of the last 3 weeks of August 2022. He works 50 hours in the first week of September 2022.
Super guarantee for each of the weeks:
= OTE × SG rate
= ordinary hours × hourly rate × SG rate
= 38 hours (as defined in the award) × $33.70 × 10.5%
= $134.46
End of example

Example: casual employee using hourly-driving-rate method
Rosie is a long-distance driver, Grade 6, working under the Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2020. She is a casual employee and paid under the hourly-driving-rate method.
The hourly driving rate for full-time employees is $33.70. Casual employees are paid an additional 15%. The rate includes 2 components:

an industry disability allowance of 1.3 times a base rate
an overtime allowance of 1.2 times a base rate.

Although the hourly rate includes a component referred to as an overtime allowance, the allowance is not deducted from the total when calculating OTE because the whole hourly driving rate is paid for what are defined to be ordinary hours of work (except where the hours worked exceed 38 hours).
Rosie has worked her ordinary hours of 38 hours in the first 3 weeks of July 2022 and 45 hours in the last week of July.
Super guarantee for each of the 4 weeks:
= OTE × SG rate
= ordinary hours × hourly rate × SG rate
= 38 hours (as defined in the award) × $38.75 ($33.70 + 15%) × 10.5%
= $154.61
End of example

Example: cents-per-kilometre method
Jack, a Grade 6 long distance driver, travelled from Melbourne to Darwin during July 2022 via the Stuart/Western Highway (3,749 km) and was paid using the cents-per-kilometre method under the Road Transport (Long Distance Operations) Award 2020. The minimum cents per kilometre rate for a full-time employee is 44.93c/km.
Jack received 44.93c/km × 3,749km = $1,684.42.
As this amount exceeds the minimum guaranteed payment stipulated in the award, Jack's employer uses his ordinary hours to work out his OTE.
For the purposes of simplicity, the ATO allows for the cents-per-kilometre rate to be applied to the kilometres driven during ‘ordinary hours of work’ based on an average driving speed of 75 kilometres per hour.
Therefore, a reasonable method of calculating the distance travelled during ordinary hours of work would be:
38 hours × 75 km = 2,850 km
The calculation to determine the minimum amount of SG required is therefore:
Super guarantee:
= OTE × SG rate
= c/km × 2,850 km × SG rate
= 44.93c/km × 2,850 km × 10.5%
= $134.45

32,Clearing house terms and conditions,"The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) provides the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (SBSCH) service. It is a free online service that helps eligible Australian small businesses and eligible withholding payer number (WPN) holders to meet their super guarantee (SG) obligations. You can send your employees’ super contributions to a single destination – the SBSCH – which distributes them to the employees’ nominated super funds.
The following terms and conditions apply to the use of the SBSCH service:
You must register with the SBSCH to use the service.
Australian small businesses, or WPN holders, with 19 or fewer employees, or with an annual aggregated turnover of less than $10 million, are eligible to use the SBSCH service. You must be eligible to use the SBSCH service
at the time you register to use the service
each time you use the service.









 
Access to the SBSCH is through the ATO’s online services (Online services for business and Online services for agents). You are responsible for establishing and maintaining access to these services.
You are responsible for the actions of persons using your access to the SBSCH service.
Access and use of the SBSCH service is monitored. The SBSCH may suspend or revoke a user’s access to the service at any time if it considers it appropriate to do so.
Information provided to the SBSCH is treated in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988. The Clearing house privacy page describes how the SBSCH intends to use and disclose the information collected by it. You should provide the employee privacy note to your employees whose information you provide to the SBSCH.
You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to the SBSCH is accurate. The SBSCH is not responsible for errors or issues that result from incorrect information provided by you.
The SBSCH will, as your agent and in accordance with your payment instructions
send the employee super contribution payments to the nominated super funds
send the corresponding payment details (or make that information available) to those nominated super funds.









 
If you pay the correct super guarantee contribution amount on or before the relevant payment due date, your super guarantee obligation is discharged at the time of payment to the SBSCH, where the SBSCH accepts the payment.
The SBSCH agrees to accept your payment if
the SBSCH has received the payment and it has not been dishonoured
you have provided payment instructions that correspond to that amount
the payment instructions are correct insofar that a super fund can receive and allocate the payment for the benefit of your employee.









 
If you make a payment to the SBSCH without a payment instruction, we will retain the payment for no more than seven (7) business days. If you do not lodge the payment instruction within that time the payment will be returned to you. If the payment we return to you includes a super guarantee amount, you will be liable for the super guarantee charge if the super guarantee amount has not been subsequently paid to, and accepted by, the SBSCH or otherwise contributed before the relevant super guarantee payment date.
If you make a payment with payment instructions that are incorrect insofar that a super fund is unable to receive and allocate the payment for the benefit of your employee, we will contact you and request you correct the payment instruction.If you correct the payment instructions so the super fund can receive and allocate the payment for the benefit of your employee, the SBSCH will accept your payment in accordance with paragraph 10 and your super guarantee obligation is still discharged on the date you made the payment to the SBSCH.In situations where we have not accepted payment due to incorrect payment instructions and have not received corrected payment instructions, we may refund the payment to you. If the payment we return to you includes a super guarantee amount, you will be liable for the super guarantee charge if the super guarantee amount has not been subsequently paid to, and accepted by, the SBSCH or otherwise contributed before the relevant super guarantee payment date.
The SBSCH may provide your details to super funds to assist in the resolution of problems relating to contributions to those super funds.
You can make payments to the SBSCH by BPAY®, credit card or direct credit. You must use the reference number provided by the SBSCH. If using BPAY, you must also use the Biller Code provided by the SBSCH.
While designed as a 24/7 service, the availability of the SBSCH service, and your access to it, is not guaranteed. Functionality is also contingent on services provided by telecommunication bodies and other external factors beyond our control.
Changes to the SBSCH service (and system) may be made at any time. Where possible, updates or changes will be scheduled to occur outside high volume periods (for example super guarantee processing periods). The SBSCH will endeavour to keep you informed and keep changes to a minimum.
The SBSCH will communicate clearing house updates to you by our website. We will also email you directly about matters relating your use of the SBSCH. You are responsible for accessing the notices and information provided to you.
The SBSCH can only be used in accordance with these terms and conditions. The terms and conditions that will apply are those when the payment is made. Each time you access and use the SBSCH signifies your acceptance of the terms of use.
To the extent permitted by law, the SBSCH is not liable for any claim, loss, liability or expense that you may incur as a result of your use or failure of the SBSCH services.
All references in these terms of use to the SBSCH include references to the Australian Government, the Australian Taxation Office and other Commonwealth bodies from time to time responsible for its management.

34,Stapled super funds for employers,"How to request stapled super fund details for new employees who don't choose a super fund.
See our webcast for steps to request your employee's stapled super fund details:
Media: Your Future Your Super – Employer Webcast)http://tv.ato.gov.au/ato-tv/media?v=nixx79jdk81466External Link (Duration: 24:56)
A stapled super fund is an existing super account linked, or 'stapled', to an individual employee so it follows them as they change jobs.
This aims to reduce account fees, avoiding new super accounts being opened every time an employee starts a new job. If you don't meet your choice of super fund obligations, additional penalties may apply.
For more information, download our Stapled super funds – Reference guide for employers (PDF, 406KB)This link will download a file.
You need to request stapled super fund details for new employees when:
you need to make super guarantee (SG) payments for that employee, and
they are eligible to choose a super fund but don't, including contractors who are employees for SG purposes.
You may need to request stapled super fund details for some employees who aren't eligible to choose their own super fund. This includes employees that are either:
temporary residents
covered by an enterprise agreement or workplace determination made before 1 January 2021.
For new employees that have not chosen a super fund, you must make contributions into either:
the employee's stapled super fund
your employer nominated account (if we advise you that they do not have a stapled super fund).
If your employee started working for you before 1 November 2021, you don’t need to request a stapled super fund. You can pay SG into their chosen fund, or your default super fund if there is no valid fund.
If an employee chooses a super fund after you have requested stapled super fund details, you have 2 months to start paying contributions into that fund. Any payments you make prior to using the chosen fund must be in accordance with the stapled super fund response provided by us.
Before you make a stapled fund request, you need to:
check ATO online services and Access Manager permissions
establish an employment relationship.
You need to offer your eligible employees a choice of super fund and pay into their chosen account. This includes for contractors who are employees for super purposes.
Most employees are eligible to choose what fund their super goes into. If your employee does not choose a super fund, you need to request their stapled super fund details from us.
You can't provide recommendations or advice about super to your employees. Only advisors licensed by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) can provide this financial advice.
See guidance on the ASIC website for communicating with employeesExternal Link about super fund choices.
You or your authorised representatives can request stapled super fund details using ATO online services.
Check and update the access levels of your authorised representatives, so that:
they have either full access in ATO online services, or custom access including the 'Employee Commencement Form' permission
their 'Employee Commencement Form' permission is removed when no longer needed, to protect your employees’ personal information.
Tax practitioners are also able to make a request on your behalf through Online services for agents.
You need to meet the same requirements when using payroll software to request stapled super fund details.
You can request your employee’s stapled super fund details after you submit a Tax file number (TFN) declaration or Single Touch Payroll (STP) pay event, which identifies that you have an employment relationship or link to your employee.
This may mean a change to your current employee onboarding to ensure this link is available in time for you to make a request before your SG contributions are due.
Your employee can complete their TFN declaration, either by:
completing the 'New employee commencement' form in their ATO online account through myGov and providing you with a copy
providing you with a paper form
providing you with the required information through your payroll software.
An STP pay event is a file generated by STP-enabled software or solutions. You must lodge this file to us on or before the date you make a payment to your employee that is subject to PAYG withholding.
There may be circumstances where you won't be able to establish an employment relationship or link before requesting stapled super fund details from us.
It is up to you to determine the best option within your business practices. We've identified several employment relationship scenarios as a guide:
Contractors entitled to SG contributions
Incomplete employee information
Employment relationship not established.
Your contractors might not be included in your STP pay events, which means you will not have an employment relationship with them in our systems.
You need to request a contractor’s stapled super fund details using the secure mail function in ATO online services.
When you submit the request, you need to include:
Topic: Superannuation
Subject: Other
Description: include reference to ‘Stapled super fund request for contractor’
Attachments
the written contract signed by both parties for the contracting arrangement
a completed and signed Contractor stapled super fund request form.
Sometimes you don't have enough information from your employee to run an STP pay event, because:
you have no TFN declaration
your payroll software won’t allow you to lodge a pay event without super details.
We have worked with the Fair Work Ombudsman to provide the following guidance to assist employers to meet both the choice of fund rules and pay slip requirements in this situation.
The regulations which outline relevant pay slip requirements were recently amended. You are exempt from including the name or number of a new employee's super fund if:
the pay slip is required to be given to the employee within 14 days, commencing on the first day the employer pays an amount to the employee for work, and
by the time the pay slip is given to the employee
the employee has not provided you with a completed Superannuation standard choice form, and
we have not notified you or your agent whether we are satisfied there is a stapled fund for the employee and, if there is, the details of that fund.
See the Fair Work Ombudsman website for information on pay slip requirementsExternal Link.
If your payroll software:
allows you to leave the super fund information blank for the first payslip, you can do this and submit your pay event
requires you to include super fund information, you should include details in the fund name field indicating it is pending a stapled super fund request (for example, 'Pending stapled super fund request').
You must still include the amount of any SG contributions you are liable to pay for the period.
This will establish the employment relationship link so you can make a stapled super fund request and determine the employee's relevant super fund details.
In most cases, submitting a Tax file number declaration or STP pay event establishes that you have an employment relationship or link to your employee. Once this link is established, you can submit a stapled fund request for that employee.
If you follow this process but receive a stapling request outcome of ‘We cannot confirm an employment relationship,’ there may have been problems processing the TFN declaration or STP pay event. The steps to rectify this depend on when you will lodge your next STP pay event.
Will you lodge another STP pay event before the SG due date?
If yes, wait until you lodge your next STP pay event. The next day, submit another stapled super fund request for the employee. If the outcome is still ‘We cannot confirm an employment relationship’, phone us on 13 10 20 for assistance.
If no, phone us on 13 10 20 for assistance.
To request stapled super fund details in ATO online services, you, or an authorised representative, need to:
Log in to ATO online services for businessExternal Link.
Navigate to the Employee super account screen via the Employees menu, and select Request to open the form.
Enter your employee's details, including their
TFN – you can enter an exemption code where an employee can't provide their TFN, but this could result in processing delays
full name, including ‘other given name’ if known
date of birth
address (residential or postal) if TFN not given.



 
Read and click the declaration to sign it – to request stapled super fund details for additional employees, tick a box under 'more employees to request?'.
Submit your request.
Registered tax or BAS agents can also complete this for you in Online services for agents.
Our online system uses rules based on the regulations to work out and return a stapled super fund in response to a request. You should be notified of the result of the stapled super fund request (on-screen) within minutes.
We notify your employee of the stapled super fund request and the fund details we provided. If an authorised representative made the request on your behalf, we notify you of the outcome of that request.
We monitor the service to ensure employers are using it appropriately and making genuine requests for stapled super fund details. If you are using the service incorrectly, such as to request information for employees who started before 1 November 2021, we may remove your access.
To avoid penalties, you must pay SG contributions according to the stapled super fund response we provide. Unless the employee has later chosen a different super fund and you pay contributions to that super fund instead.
If you're unable to access online services, phone us on 13 10 20 (or +61 2 6216 1111 for overseas callers) to request details of a stapled super fund.
Before providing information over the phone, we must establish the identity of the person making the request. If you don't have access to Online services for business, the primary contact for your business needs to contact us to give you authority to request stapled super fund details on their behalf.
Your payroll software may allow you to make requests directly from the product. Please contact your software provider:

have an employment relationship link with each of the new employees.
Bulk requests have a service standard of up to 14 business days. We recommend allowing extra time for bulk requests that are close to your super payment due dates.
You can download and complete the Stapled super fund bulk request (XLSX, 352KB)This link will download a file.
You, or an authorised representative, can submit the bulk request form through the secure mail function in ATO online services, noting:
you should only submit one form per request
if you are a member of a consolidated group, each entity must submit their own forms separately
only an authorised person can submit a request.
Once your file is processed, you will receive a response through the secure mail function within online services. The response contains the file submitted to us with the outcomes of the stapled super fund request for each employee.
The bulk request process will be decommissioned in March 2024. It is an interim service to support employers until the payroll software solution is available.
The payroll software solution is available for software providers to incorporate into their software. It allows you to request stapled super fund details from within payroll software, rather than making separate requests via ATO online services.
If you are currently using the bulk request process, we encourage you to discuss your software solutions with your software provider.
If you contributed to a super fund your employee did not choose without making a stapled super fund request, you will have both a:
choice shortfall penalty
super guarantee charge (SGC).
You should immediately request a stapled super fund for your employee. Begin making contributions to the fund that is returned in response to your request.
To avoid the choice shortfall penalty, make sure you:
request the stapled super fund details for your employee as soon as possible if they have not provided you with their choice of fund
pay the employee’s full SG contribution to the stapled super fund we return to you in your request
pay the contribution to the stapled super fund by the quarterly due date.
If the stapled super fund we provide rejects your SG payment, you may need to find an alternate super fund to make the SG payment to, by either:
asking your employee to choose an alternative super fund
requesting stapled super fund details from us for the employee again.
Phone us on 13 10 20 for an alternate fund if your online request gives you the same stapled super fund details. If an alternate fund cannot be determined, we will tell you that you can contribute to your default fund.
If you don't make your SG payment on time and to the right fund, you must:
lodge an SCG statement, and
pay the SGC to us.
However, if your SG payment is late as a direct result of the stapled fund rejecting your SG payment, you may be eligible for a reduction in the amount of SGC you have to pay.
To be eligible for an SGC reduction, you must have:
been notified of the employee's stapled super fund details by us
made an SG payment to the stapled super fund before the due date and that payment was rejected
made a subsequent SG payment to an alternate super fund, and
lodged an SGC statement.
If you took all the above steps and want to request a reduction in the resulting SGC liability, phone us on 13 10 20.

35,How to pay super,"Super guarantee (SG) contributions are payments employers must make to their employees' complying funds or retirement savings accounts to avoid the SG charge.
Pay employee SG contributions electronically to either a:
complying super fund: a fund that meets specific requirements and obligations under super law
retirement savings account (RSA): an account that provides a low cost and low risk savings strategy for retirement.
Report payments electronically through:
SuperStream
Single Touch Payroll.
You must ensure the fund or RSA meets rules on:
MySuper productsExternal Link
choice of super fund.
You must pay SG contributions by the quarterly due dates – 28 days after the end of each quarter to avoid the SG charge.
Eligible small businesses can pay super for their employees through the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House.
Some super funds require employers to contribute monthly. By registering with these funds, you agree to make monthly contributions to that fund.
Some industrial awards require employers to pay super contributions to a specific super fund. Make sure you check if this affects your employees.
You can arrange to make post-tax super payments on behalf of your employees. These payments are personal super contributions.
You must make these contributions according to:
the employee's terms of employment
legal requirements
industrial award conditions.
Your employee's personal super contributions don't count towards your SG obligations.
You can use Super Fund LookupExternal Link to check if a fund is compliant.
If they are not listed, you can get written confirmation from the fund's trustee.
Written confirmation must state that the fund:
is a complying super fund
intends to accept your super contributions
will continue to meet the relevant legal requirements.
If the fund fails to comply, written confirmation will protect you from penalties.
If you pay contributions to a non-complying super fund, the contributions:
won't count towards meeting your SG obligations
won't be tax-deductible
may incur a fringe benefits tax (FBT) liability.
SG contributions you make for your employees are tax deductible. You can only claim the deduction in the financial year payments are made.
To claim a deduction, a contribution must be made:
in accordance with an industrial award or agreement
to reduce the liability of the SG charge
28 days after a person turns 75.
Missed or late super payments may incur the SG charge. The SG charge is not tax deductible.
You can make a late payment:
to reduce the super guarantee charge
as pre-payment of a future super contribution (for the same employee).
Example: timing of super payments affects tax deduction claim year
Malia has 5 employees. In 2019, she wanted to claim a tax deduction for SG contributions made in 2017–18.
To do this, Malia needed to pay SG contributions to her employee's complying funds or RSAs by 30 June 2018 (end of the financial year).
However, Malia did not pay the SG contributions for the fourth quarter of 2017–18 until 5 July 2018.
Therefore, Malia could not claim these fourth quarter contributions as tax deductions until the next financial year (2018–19).

36,Clearing house troubleshooting,"Find out how to resolve problems you may have when using the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (the clearing house).
This issue is caused by an invalid unique superannuation identifier (USI) or ABN in an employee's super fund details.
If the system is timing out when trying to submit a payment instruction, check your employee’s super fund details are correct. You will need to cancel the instruction, update the super fund details and create a new payment instruction.
There may have been a change in ownership of a superannuation product that one of your employees has chosen.
Your employee will have this information.
When a super fund changes an ABN or unique superannuation identifier (USI) you need to:
update the employee's details with the new ABN and USI
delete any payment instruction created before updating the employee's details
create a new payment instruction
submit the payment instruction.
You have only entered a mobile number in the mobile phone field.
You will need to enter a work number. If a work number is not available, you will need to enter your mobile number into the work hours phone number field in this format:
Area code: 04
Phone: XXXXXXXX
This may be a result of having 2 zeros at the start of the PRN.
Remove the 2 zeros from the start of the PRN when making the payment.

37,How much super to pay,"Work out how much super you have to pay and what's considered ordinary time earnings (OTE) and overtime.
As an employer, it is compulsory that you pay eligible employees super guarantee (SG) at least 4 times a year.
The minimum SG rate you must pay for each eligible employee is 11% of their ordinary time earnings (OTE). However, this is scheduled to progressively increase to 12% by 2025.
If you don't pay the required SG amount by the quarterly due date, you must pay the super guarantee charge.
Before you calculate how much SG to pay, you should work out if you have to pay super.
To work out how much SG to pay, you can use our calculator.
Super guarantee contributions calculator
The current super guarantee percentage is the minimum required by law. You may pay SG at a higher rate under an award or agreement.
To manually work out how much super to pay for a quarter, multiply your employee's OTE, based on salary and wages paid in the quarter (before tax), by the SG rate. The SG rate applied is based on when you pay your eligible workers, not when they earned their income. If you're paying super at a higher rate, use that rate.
For employees who started during the quarter, work out their super based on any salary and wages paid in the quarter.
Example: working out the minimum super contribution
Xuan employs Danni. During the July 2021 – September 2021 quarter of the 2021–22 financial year, Danni's ordinary time earnings are $15,000.
Xuan works out the minimum super contribution for Danni for the quarter:
$15,000 × 10% = $1500
Xuan contributes $1500 to Danni's super fund by the quarterly due date, which is 28 October 2021. If Jan fails to do this, she may have to pay the super guarantee charge.
End of example

Example: working out the correct super contribution rate – fortnightly pay period
Peter employs Sue. For the pay fortnightly pay period ending 27 June 2022, Sue's ordinary time earnings are $3,000. Peter pays Sue on 1 July 2022. The minimum super contribution for Sue for the pay period is:
$3,000 × 10.5% = $315
Peter contributes $315 for the July to September quarter to Sue’s super fund by the quarterly due date, which is 28 October 2022.
The SG rate on the date the salary is paid applies.
End of example

Example: working out the correct super contribution rate – monthly pay period
XYZ Pty Ltd employs Neil and pays a monthly salary. For the monthly pay period starting 21 June 2022 and ending 20 July 2022, Neil’s ordinary time earnings are $6,200. XYZ Pty Ltd pays Neil on 6 July 2022. The minimum super contribution for Neil for the pay period is:
$6,200 × 10.5% = $651
XYZ Pty Ltd contributes $651 for the July to September quarter to Neil’s super fund by the quarterly due date, which is 28 October 2022.
End of example
Ordinary time earnings (OTE) is the gross amount your employees earn for their ordinary hours of work (before tax). It includes:
over-award payments
commissions
shift loading
annual leave loading
allowances
bonuses.
Check a specific type of payment with List of payments that are ordinary time earnings.
Your employee's ordinary hours are the normal hours they work unless their hours are specified in an award or agreement.
If you can't determine the normal hours of work (such as for casual workers), the actual hours the employee works are their ordinary hours of work.
The Fair Work Act's definition of ordinary hours for workers not under an award or agreement, caps them at 38 hours. This definition does not override the super laws above.
If you pay a contractor mainly for their labour, you calculate SG on the labour component of the contract.
Overtime payments are not OTE, provided the employee's ordinary hours of work are clearly identified.
If you can't distinctly identify overtime amounts, all the hours actually worked are included in the employee's ordinary hours of work.
The above rules also apply if the payments are calculated as an annualised or lump sum component of a total salary package. Overtime payments must be clearly identifiable, otherwise all hours worked are OTE.
You don't have to pay SG for your employee's earnings above a certain limit, called the maximum contribution base.
This maximum super contribution base amount is indexed annually and is usually available before the start of the financial year.
It does not apply to other mandated contributions, such as contributions you pay under an award.
Example: maximum contribution base for SG
Rory is the Marketing Manager of ABC Pty Ltd.
During the July–September quarter of the 2021–22 financial year, Rory's OTE is $60,000.
The quarterly maximum contribution base for 2021–22 is $58,920
ABC Pty Ltd uses the maximum contribution base to work out the SG contribution for Rory for the quarter:
$58,920 × 10% = $5892
Rory's OTE above $58,920 is ignored.
End of example
You must pay super on back pay of amounts that are OTE, even if the employee no longer works for you.
If you don't, you'll be liable for the super guarantee charge.
Example: back pay for an employee that has finished employment
On 30 June 2021, Sue finished her employment with company ZYX. In September 2021, ZYX realised it had been underpaying its employees. The company needed to give Sue back pay of an extra 2% for the period from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021.
ZYX must pay an SG contribution for the back pay by the quarterly due date of 28 October 2021 – that is, 28 days after the quarter in which Sue was actually paid.
Between 1 January to 30 June 2021, Sue’s OTE is $60,000. ZYX works out the total back pay amount for this period:
$60,000 × 2% = 1,200
The company calculates Sue's SG contribution at 10% of her back pay. This is because the salary and wages back payment was made after 1 July 2021, when the rate increased from 9.5% to 10%.
SG contributions must be paid on the back pay for the quarter that corresponds to the date of payment – in this case, the September 2021 quarter. The payment would usually be made to the fund the company paid Sue's last super contribution into.
ZYX pays Sue on the 6 September 2021. The additional super contribution for Sue for the period is:
$1,200 × 10% = $120
If the company doesn't pay the minimum super on time to a complying fund or retirement savings account, they will have to pay the superannuation guarantee charge to us.

38,SuperStream for employers,"SuperStream is the way all employers must pay employee superannuation guarantee contributions to super funds. With SuperStream, money and data are sent electronically in a standard format.
Your employee super information is linked to your super contributions by a unique payment reference number (PRN).
This means you can make all your super contributions in a single transaction, even if the payments are going to multiple super funds.
If the only contributions you make are personal contributions for yourself or contributions to a related self-managed super fund (SMSF), you don't need to use SuperStream because these are excepted contributions.
All SuperStream communications:
are encrypted
use sending and receiving protocols that all parties must follow.
Employee information security is important and starts with you, and all your dealings in the super system. This means you should:
apply security best practices when personal information is stored in payroll solutions or sent over the internet
make sure any service providers you use have strong information security policies, and terms and conditions.
In just 3 simple steps, you can meet SuperStream requirements.
To meet SuperStream requirements, you can use the following electronic options:
Payroll system
Super fund online system
Super clearing house
Small Business Superannuation Clearing House 
EFT or BPAY direct to the fund
Messaging portal
You can also ask your accountant or bookkeeper to help you with one of these options.
Check with your software provider to ensure your payroll system is SuperStream-compliant. You may need to update your software.
You can also use the SuperStream Certified Product RegisterExternal Link to check if your software is compliant.
Some payroll systems cover data and payments, and some are data only. This means you may need to make payments to each fund separately. The payment must be electronic (electronic funds transfer or BPAY®).
Large super funds have online payment services you can use. Check with your super fund to ensure it is SuperStream compliant.
A clearing house pays super to your employees' super funds for you. You send a single electronic payment to the clearing house with all your employees' super contribution data, and the clearing house does the rest.
You can use the free Small Business Superannuation Clearing House if you have either:
19 or fewer employees
a turnover of less than $10 million a year.
You can also choose to use:
other commercial clearing house options
your super fund's clearing house.
Talk to your super fund to see what they offer.
The Small Business Superannuation Clearing House (the clearing house) is a free service you can use if you are a business with either:
19 or fewer employees
an annual aggregated turnover of less than $10 million.
You make your super guarantee contributions for all employees as a single electronic payment to the clearing house. The clearing house will then distribute the payments to each employee's super fund.
Even if you outsource some parts of making super contributions, you're still responsible for ensuring your employees' super contributions are paid correctly.
The clearing house is accessed via the ATO's Online services for business, Online services for agents or ATO online services in myGov.
If you pay directly to a super fund with EFT (direct credit or direct debit) or BPAY, you must also send the employees information electronically (not by email).
Direct contributions can only continue with special agreement from each of your super funds.
Contact your fund to see if direct contributions can continue or if any changes are required.
If you can continue paying direct to the fund, you can also use a messaging portal for the electronic information requirements. A messaging portal will generate reference numbers to use in your online banking.
A messaging portal can convert contribution data for your employees to a SuperStream compliant format and send it to the relevant funds for you.
You still need to make one electronic payment.
Talk to your messaging portal provider and financial institution about your options.
Collect the following information from your employees:
your employee's tax file number (TFN)
the Australian business number (ABN) of your employee's super fund
the unique superannuation identifier (USI) of your employee's super fund. You can look these up through:
Super Fund LookupExternal Link – USI and product names
SuperStream – Fund USI and SPIN lookup tableExternal Link
You can also use the online service, EmployerTICK, to validate employee details. For more information on the service, see the EmployerTICK user guide.
If your employees have an SMSF, you'll need the following information:
your employee's TFN
the ABN of your employee's SMSF
the bank account details of your employee's SMSF
the electronic service address of your employee's SMSF.
If your employee wants you to contribute to their SMSF, provide them with a standard choice form and ask them to return it to you within 28 days. If you don’t receive the information you may make the contributions to your default fund.
If you're paying your own super contributions to your own SMSF, you don't need this information for these contributions.
You must send the payment and data on the same day. This lets the super fund match your payment and information and allocate the contribution to the fund member's account.
If you use a commercial clearing house, the employee's super contribution is counted as being paid on the date the super fund receives it, not the date the clearing house receives it from you. Check with your clearing house to make sure you allow enough time for your payments to be processed before the quarterly due dates.
If you use our Small Business Superannuation Clearing House, your super obligations are met on the date the clearing house accepts the payment (so long as the super fund doesn't reject the payment). This is because the clearing house is an approved clearing house under government regulations.
If you're not eligible for an ABN, you can use your withholding payer number (WPN) to use SuperStream.
Your WPN is found on your pay as you go (PAYG) withholding registration advice or your activity statement.
A WPN is shorter than an ABN so, depending on your SuperStream solution, you may need to:
enter your 8 or 9-digit WPN into the WPN field without any leading zeros, if you are registering for the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House
add leading zeros when providing your WPN, if you are paying contributions directly to super funds.

39,Identify reportable employer super contributions,"Find out about reportable and non-reportable employer super contributions, record keeping and information for employees.
Reportable employer super contributions (RESC) are not included in your employee's assessable income. They do not affect the way you calculate super contributions for your employees.
The following employer super contributions are reportable:
additional contributions as part of an employee's individual salary package
additional contributions under a salary sacrifice arrangement
pre-tax amounts paid to an employee's super fund at the employee's direction, such as directing an annual bonus into super.
You must report extra contributions if:
your employee can influence the rate or amount of super you contribute for them; and
the contributions are in addition to the compulsory contributions you must make under        
super guarantee
a collectively negotiated industrial agreement
the rules of a super fund
federal, state or territory law.
The extra contributions are reportable super contributions for employees, unless you show that:
the extra contributions are made for administrative simplicity
a documented policy is in place that does not allow an employee to influence the contributions you make on their behalf.
Example: extra contributions – individual employment contract
Adnan is an employee of Johnson Pty Ltd. While negotiating his individual common law employment contract. Johnson Pty Ltd agrees to pay Adnan super contributions of 12% of his salary.
Johnson Pty Ltd has no policy about the employer contributions it pays for its employees. It allows employees to negotiate any rate of employer contribution they wish over the super guarantee rate required by law. Adnan and the other employees have contributions made on their behalf at varying rates.
Johnson Pty Ltd must record the extra contributions made for Adnan as reportable employer super contributions. In the 2022–23 financial year, Adnan's ordinary time earnings (OTE) are the same as his salary, so the amount recorded is 1.5% of Adnan's salary. That is, the amount that is additional to the minimum contributions Johnson Pty Ltd must make under super guarantee law.
Summary

Additional contributions: employee individual salary package.
Johnson Pty Ltd must record extra contributions.
Johnson Pty Ltd must make 1.5% additional contributions.

End of example

Example: non-arm's length agreement
Tula is an employee and director of MGK Pty Ltd. Tula's employment conditions are governed by an industrial agreement. The agreement was negotiated between Tula and the other employees of MGK Pty Ltd.
The other employees are Tula's husband and their 2 adult children. There was no external involvement in the negotiation of the agreement. It was not made at arm's length. The agreement requires MGK Pty Ltd to make super contributions equal to 15% of the employees' salaries to super.
The employer contributions made on behalf of Tula and her fellow employees are required under the terms of an agreement. The agreement was not negotiated at arms' length. Therefore, Tula and the other employees could influence the contributions. For all 4 employees, MGK Pty Ltd must report the difference between the minimum amount required to meet super guarantee obligations and the amount paid under the industrial agreement.
Summary

Industrial agreement not negotiated at arm's length.
Employees can influence the super contributions.
MGK Pty Ltd must report the difference between the minimum amount required to meet SG obligations and the amount paid under the agreement.

End of example

Example: employee influence on outcome
Under Jill's industrial agreement, she is required to contribute 5.75% of her OTE to an industry super fund. Jill can make the contribution from either her pre-tax or post-tax income. She decides to make the contribution from her pre-tax income.
While Jill's contribution is in accordance with her industrial agreement, she has the capacity to influence the way that the amount is contributed so that her assessable income is reduced. This amount is a reportable employer super contribution.
End of example
The following employer super contributions are not reportable:
super guarantee contributions
contributions required by collectively negotiated industrial agreements
matching contributions under a collective agreement (matching contributions under an individual agreement are reportable)
to a defined benefit fund (exceptions may apply)
contributions required by super fund rules or a law
extra contributions that the employee could not influence, such as extra contributions for administrative simplicity or accepted employer policy
contributions from the employee's after-tax income.
Example: industrial agreement without employee influence
Amanda operates a business employing 20 workers. Under their industrial agreement, Amanda must contribute 13% of her employees' OTE to a super fund, which is more than the amount required under super guarantee law.
Apart from voting on the agreement, Amanda's employees have no influence over the amount of super she contributes. This means that the super contributions Amanda makes for her workers are not reportable employer super contributions.
End of example
You could pay more super than required because of:
an employer policy or similar arrangements
administrative or payroll simplicity.
If your employee cannot influence these contributions, they are not reportable. It does not matter if the employee is employed under a collectively negotiated industrial agreement or individual employment contract.
Example: extra contributions under employer policy
Clarke Pty Ltd employs different types of workers on individual contracts and collective industrial agreements. Clarke Pty Ltd has always paid employer contributions at a minimum rate of 12% of their employee's salary. This is regardless of the type of agreement. Employees are not able to negotiate an employer contribution rate lower than 12%.
The company policy is long-standing and is documented in Clarke Pty Ltd's record-keeping system. No employee is receiving less than 12% employer contribution support.
The 12% employer super contributions are not reportable because the employees have no influence over the contribution rate.
If employees do have the power to vary their employer contribution rate, the amounts over any compulsory contributions made will be reportable employer super contributions.
Summary

Clarke Pty Ltd pays employer super contributions at 12% of employees' salary.
The 12% employer super contributions are not reportable.
In accordance with company policy, employee contributions over the compulsory 12% are reportable.

End of example
You must keep records to show whether your employee influenced the super contributions you made on their behalf.
This includes records of:
how you calculated reportable employer super contributions
how you calculated the employee-influenced portion of the total employer contribution
how you calculated your employee's salary or ordinary time earnings (OTE)
relevant salary sacrifice agreements
relevant industrial agreements.
You must keep your records:

40,Where to pay super,"It's important you pay super guarantee (SG) contributions to the right super fund account to avoid penalties.
SG contributions should be paid to one of the following:
Employee's chosen fund
Employee's stapled super fund
Other fund that meets your choice of fund obligations
You must pay SG contributions to your eligible employee's chosen fund if they nominate a fund. An employee will generally tell you their choice of fund by completing a standard choice form.
You have 2 months to start paying contributions into their chosen fund. If you have received a choice of super fund form from a new employee from 1 November 2021, and you must contribute before this time, if you don’t pay to the employee's choice fund, you should pay into their stapled super fund or your employer nominated account if the ATO advises you that they do not have a stapled super fund.
From 1 November 2021, where your new employees don't choose a super fund, you may need to request their ‘stapled super fund’ details from us.
You must pay SG contributions to a stapled super fund if you have requested stapled super fund details for your employee and we have provided these to you.
If the stapled super fund account provided by us can't accept contributions for the employee, you should make another request for the employee’s stapled super fund via ATO online services. This may occur, for example, if the account has since been closed or a defined benefit account won't accept your contributions.
If the stapled super fund account provided by us is a self-managed super fund, you should obtain the electronic services address and bank account details from your employee.
Phone us on 13 10 20 if:
you make another request for an alternate stapled super fund and the same, or no, stapled super fund details are returned
your employee can't provide you with their self-managed super fund bank account details.
